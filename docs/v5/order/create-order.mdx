- **Supported order type (`orderType`):**<br/>
Limit order: `orderType`=_Limit_, it is necessary to specify order qty and price.<br/>
<a href="https://www.bybit.com/en-US/help-center/bybitHC_Article?language=en_US&id=000001135">Market order</a>: <code>orderType</code>=<i>Market</i>, execute at the best price in the Bybit market until the transaction is completed. When selecting a market order, the `price` is empty. In the futures trading system, in order to protect the serious slippage of the market order, the Bybit trading system will convert the market order into a limit order for matching. will be cancelled. The slippage threshold refers to the percentage that the order price deviates from the latest transaction price. The current threshold is set to 3% for BTC contracts and 5% for other contracts.

- **Supported timeInForce strategy:**<br/>
`GTC`<br/>
`IOC`<br/>
`FOK`<br/>
`PostOnly`: If the order would be filled immediately when submitted, it will be **cancelled**. The purpose of this is to protect your order during the submission process. If the matching system cannot entrust the order to the order book due to price changes on the market, it will be cancelled. For the PostOnly order type, the quantity that can be submitted in a single order is more than other types of orders, please refer to the parameter `lotSizeFilter > postOnlyMaxOrderQty` in the [instruments-info](../market/instrument#) endpoint.

- **How to create conditional order:**<br/>
When submitting an order, if `triggerPrice` is set, the order will be automatically converted into a conditional order. In addition, the conditional order does not occupy the margin. If the margin is insufficient after the conditional order is triggered, the order will be cancelled.

- **<a href="https://www.bybit.com/en-US/help-center/bybitHC_Article?language=en_US&id=000001138">Take profit / Stop loss</a>**: You can set TP/SL while placing orders. Besides, you could modify the position's TP/SL.

- **Order quantity**: The quantity of perpetual contracts you are going to buy/sell. For the order quantity, Bybit only supports positive number at present.

- **Order price**: Place a limit order, this parameter is **required**. If you don't have position, the long order price
should be higher than _10%_ of the market price and lower than 1 million. If you have position, the price should be higher than the _liquidation price_.
For the minimum unit of the price change, please refer to the `priceFilter` > `tickSize` field in the [instruments-info](../market/instrument#) endpoint.

- **orderLinkId**: You can customize the active order ID. We can link this ID to the order ID in the system. Once the
active order is successfully created, we will send the unique order ID in the system to you. Then, you can use this order
ID to cancel active orders, and if both orderId and orderLinkId are entered in the parameter input, Bybit will prioritize the orderId to process the corresponding order. Meanwhile, your customized order ID should be no longer than 36 characters and should be **unique**.

- **Open orders up limit:**<br/>
**Future:** Each account can hold a maximum of _500_ **active** orders simultaneously. This is contract-specific, so the following situation is allowed: _the same account can hold 300 BTCUSD active orders and 280 ETHUSD active orders at the same time._ For **conditional** orders, each account can hold a maximum of **10 active orders** simultaneously. When the upper limit of orders is reached, you can still place orders with parameters of **reduceOnly** or **closeOnTrigger**.<br/>
**Spot:** No limit for normal order but a maximum of 30 open TP/SL orders<br/>
**Option:** a maximum of 100 open orders

- **Rate limit:**<br/>
Please refer to [rate limit table](../rate-limit#trade). If you need to raise the rate limit, please contact your client manager or submit an application via <a href="https://www.bybit.com/future-activity/en-US/institutional-services">here</a>
