Withdraw assets from your Bybit account. You can make an off-chain transfer if the target wallet address is from Bybit. This means that no blockchain fee will be charged.

:::danger
* For **UTA** users, please note that Bybit will merge `SPOT` account into `UNIFIED` account (est.end of Feb), so please adjust your withdrawal logic
by transferring funds to `FUND` account first, then call withdraw API.
* How do I know if my account is a UTA account? Call [this endpoint](../user/apikey-info#), and if `uta`=1, then it is a UTA account.
:::

:::caution
* Make sure you have whitelisted your wallet address <a href="https://www.bybit.com/user/assets/money-address">here</a>
* Can query by the master UID's api key **only**
