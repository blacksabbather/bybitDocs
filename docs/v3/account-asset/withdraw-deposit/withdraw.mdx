* For **UTA** users, please note that Bybit will merge `SPOT` account into `UNIFIED` account (est.end of Feb), so please adjust your withdrawal logic
by transferring funds to `FUND` account first, then call withdraw API.
* How do I know if my account is a UTA account? Call [this endpoint](apikey-info#), and if `uta`=1, then it is a UTA account.
