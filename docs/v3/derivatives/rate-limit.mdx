## IP Rate Limit
:::caution
If you receive an **HTTP 403** (Access Denied) response, your IP has been either temporarily or permanently banned.
**You should immediately review the below guidelines to ensure your application does not continue to violate the limit.**
If you are still banned after 30 minutes, you likely have a permanent ban.
:::

We do not recommend running your application at the very edge of these limits in case abnormal network activity results in an unexpected violation.

* `GET`/`POST` method (shared):
    * 120 requests per second for 5 consecutive seconds

:::note
All traffic to `api.bybit.com` or `api.bytick.com` share this limit regardless of if it accesses Spot, Derivatives or Options.
:::

After violating the limit your IP will be banned for a set period of time (usually 30 minutes). Continually violating
the limit will result in a permanent ban. We cannot undo permanent bans or shorten temporary bans.

## API Rate Limit
:::caution
If you receive `"ret_msg": "Too many visits!"` in the JSON response, you have hit the API rate limit.
:::

:::tip
For now, api rate limit for Unified margin is a bit different.
* `linear`: rate limit is count by **minute**
* `option`: rate limit is count by **second**
:::

The API rate limit is based on the **rolling time window per second and UID**. In other words, it is per second per UID.
Every request to the API returns response header shown in the code panel:
* `X-Bapi-Limit-Status` - your remaining requests for current endpoint
* `X-Bapi-Limit` - your current limit for current endpoint
* `X-Bapi-Limit-Reset-Timestamp` - the timestamp indicating when your request limit resets if you have exceeded your rate_limit. Otherwise, this is just the current timestamp.
